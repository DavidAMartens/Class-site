      <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">That was the year we started playing COD. We were just chilling around we would do a lot of outside activities because we didn’t have a lot of technology. We would watch YouTube videos and play some games. Go to six flags and splish splash when it was summer time.</p>

      <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">My best memory of that time was coop zombies World at war that became my favorite game because we used to play it all the time. I got obsessed with zombies because of how often we played it. </p>

      <p class="js_wow yeardesc fadeInUp"> That was the time when you left to go to a different school.  we had a little bit of a... not a falling out, but more of a quiet period because of school. We didn’t talk during the school year, but during the summer we would hang out with the extended group and chill around and drank our asses off. Obviously im kidding this was freshman year</p>

      <h3 class="js_wow year fadeInUp animateD_02">Story</h3>

      <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">One time it was you me Tyler and Nick Domino. We were in your attic and we were high as shit and smoking out of a hookah in your attic. Your dad wasn’t home and neither was your mom but I remember panicking when your dad was coming home. We knocked the hookah over and since we were high as balls we didn’t really realize what was happening. You went downstairs to get a towel to pick up the hot coal. I told Tyler to tell you that your floor is catching on fire. You guys came bolting up and you were like HOLY SHIT THE FLOOR IS ON FIRE! You say 'I didn't know what the fuck was going on. Im taking a piss and hear giggling outside the door. I open it and Tyler casually goes ''Hey David your floor is on fire'' with a big smile. I didnt believe him because he said it so casually.'</p>

      <h3 class="js_wow year fadeInUp animateD_02">End of highschool</h3>

      <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">This was when partying really kicked up a notch. We did things along the lines of drinking and smoking. We would have days were we would just completely be cross faded and it was just incomprehensible for the entire thing. Around this time we introduced Kummi into our group so it started to expand past you and me and branched out to include Kummi. I was happy about that because kummi is a great guy and Im so happy he is apart of our lives and our friendship.</p>

      <h3 class="js_wow year fadeInUp animateD_02">Summers</h3>

       <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">we would go to Fire Island everyday over the summer. We would take the boat out. Oh god I cant believe I forgot about the old boat. When we were younger, you, your dad, me, Dan and my dad would go out on the boat and we would hit the hardest waves dude. It was you me and dan and we would sit in the front of this 12 foot boat just getting hit by wave after wave after wave. Flying like four feet in the air. Man that was the craziest shit because it was practically a free rollercoaster ride every time we went out. Every thump would take our breath away but we couldn’t stop laughing even though we were short of breath.</p>

      <h3 class="js_wow year fadeInUp animateD_02">End of highschool</h3>

      <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">That’s when we would have forty Fridays and we would do stupid thing and get into all sorts of drunk shenanagans. I remember one or two bad times where we would get into stupid little arguments but it all ended up strengthening our friendship. Around that time we became more independent we didn’t need any more parental supervision. We were all just together going here and there.</p>

      <h3 class="js_wow year fadeInUp animateD_02">Do you think friends are even more important as we age?</h3>


      <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">Of course. I think friends are a vital part of your life because without them you really become this lonely recluse but with them you learn how to branch out and develop yourself as a more well rounded human being and the longer you have them the stronger the bonds and even though you might branch out you still always share those similar roots, that togetherness from childhood. There is nothing that can really surmount that. There is nothing that can really pass that kind of bond because it is just something that shakes you as a human being and there is nothing else like it</p>

        <h3 class="js_wow year fadeInUp animateD_02">Do you think it is harder to make friends as we age?</h3>

        <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">I think that it becomes a little more of a difficult task being that people are so different as you age, people have so many different life experiences, some people you cant relate to. I know one of my friends from school, his dad died and it took me a long time to really figure out what that was and what that would be like. But the differences that people have can create a type of synergy between them but having friends that you have know since your childhood that synergy is isn’t really needed because you are the same, your personalities grew together and in the same way so that even if you separated, our bases were cemented to ourselves and are such a huge part of who we are and we went through that together. Its made me who I am.</p>

      <h3 class="js_wow year fadeInUp animateD_02">Why are we still friends?</h3>

       <p class="js_wow mediumtxt fadeInUp animateD_02">Because we have the same bases of who we are. We grew up to be so similar that by the time we started to become different people in college years, the base that we were could never be changed and the thing that make us us are the things that we have in common.</p>
