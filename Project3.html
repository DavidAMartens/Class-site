 <p> Critical review, of 'Fuck Content' Essay...</p>

 <p>  If the form and design are properly executed, mundane content wonâ€™t matter. I believe a good designer can take something ordinary and make it seem extraordinary just by the form of the design. </p>

 <p> I want to take an opposite take on my take. I feel like today, everyone does not pay attention to content. Most people scroll thhrough social media consently and not really taking the second and absorbing the information. </p>
